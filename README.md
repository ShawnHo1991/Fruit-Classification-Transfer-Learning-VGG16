### Introduction 

Classify images of fruits using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model. Transfer learning enables leveraging a model trained on a large dataset (like ImageNet) and applying it to your dataset with fewer data and computational resources.

### Aim 

The aim is to build a fruit image classifier using transfer learning. You will fine-tune a pre-trained model on a custom dataset of fruit images to enable it to classify fruits effectively.

### Tool

Transfer Learning with VGG16 and ReduceLROnPlateau + EarlyStopping. Unfreeze the last 5 layers for fine-tuning but freeze BatchNorm layers to speed up fine-tuning.
